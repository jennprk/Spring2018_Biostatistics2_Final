#Question 3 - Build a model to predict whether a patient will die in the first 180 days after hospitalization, based on all pre-treatment 
covariates. Comment on the interpretation of the coefficients of this model.

fit1<-glm(death~temp + heart_rate + blood_pressure + resp_rate + wbc + PaO2_FIO2 + PaCo2 + ph + sodium + potassium + hematocrit + 
bilirubin + creatinine + albumin + glasgow_coma + age + sex + race + education + income + medical_insurance, data=data, family=binomial)
summary(fit1)

Each coefficient is the estimated amount by which the log odds of death would increase if each covariate were one unit higher. 
For example, 0.0033066 is the estimated amount by which the log odds of death would increase if blood pressure were one unit higher. 
The log odds of death when all other covariates is 0 is the intercept in the first row. In R, the the glm function will result in "NA" as
the co-efficient for highly correlated variables.
